	<h1>Chatbot User Manual</h1>
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>The Chatbot is a conversational agent that uses natural language processing (NLP) to simulate human-like conversation. It is built on the GPT-2 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 2) language model and uses BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for sentiment analysis. The Chatbot can carry on a conversation on a variety of topics and can respond to user input in a conversational and engaging way.</p>
	<h2>Installation</h2>
	<p>The Chatbot requires Python 3.6 or higher and the following Python packages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>torch</li>
		<li>transformers</li>
		<li>sqlite3</li>
		<li>datetime</li>
		<li>json</li>
		<li>random</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can install these packages using pip by running the following command:</p>
	<pre><code>pip install torch transformers sqlite3 datetime json random</code></pre>
	<h2>Usage</h2>
	<p>To use the Chatbot, you can run the following command:</p>
	<pre><code>python main.py</code></pre>
	<p>This will start the Chatbot and allow you to carry on a conversation with it. You can exit the Chatbot at any time by typing 'exit'.</p>
	<h2>Customization</h2>
	<p>The Chatbot can be customized by modifying the configuration file (config.json) located in the project directory. This file contains various parameters that can be adjusted to change the behavior of the Chatbot, such as the conversational flows and the GPT-2 model configuration.</p>
	<h2>Credits</h2>
	<p>The Chatbot was developed by [Your Name] as part of [Your Project Name]. It is based on the GPT-2 language model developed by OpenAI and the BERT model developed by Google.</p>
